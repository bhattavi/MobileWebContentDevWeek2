This was an assignment which was as follows:

Assignments: Ultra Corporation Web Page

Create a new responsive web page for the fictional Ultra Corporation. The page should try to sell the reader something. If your first assignment's web page was responsive, you can start with that instead. Give the page a 3-column layout, and make its layout responsive to the width of the browser, so that the page looks good on smaller browsers, and uses a 1-column layout on phones.

Use DIVs or other HTML tags styled with grid styles and @media queries to implement your layout. Writing the layout code the first time will take a while. Use @media queries to resize your images on phones. 
On phones, your single column layout will need to hug the edges of the browser window to look good, with images typically having a 100% width. Switch column widths from pixels (px) to percentages (%) or fractions (fr) on mobile to accomplish this.
Use images, links, gradients, rounded corners, shadows, and css transitions or animations in your page. Don’t worry too much about “attractiveness”.
